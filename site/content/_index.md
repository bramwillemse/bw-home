# Bram Willemse
I have an analytical mind. I naturally connect dots and people. I am eager to learn, eager to lead and an ambassador to your users.

## Developer of Websites
I am a senior front-end developer and interaction designer, focusing on web standards, architecture and design systems.

## Driver of cars
I love cars. To look at them, to listen to them and the best: to drive them. I own a small sports car and love to drive any car I haven't driven before.

## Runner of trails
I am a trail runner. I like to escape the crowded city of Amsterdam. And I love the pysical and mental challenge of long distance trails.
