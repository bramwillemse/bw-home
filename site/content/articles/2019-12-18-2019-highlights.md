## Running
### Race
The Morvan Oxygene Trail was going to suck. I already had given up on my goal to run my first ultra marathon, because I got injured a month before. To make things worse I’d had a fever the night before the 30km race.

From the first step I felt I had no energy in my body. Every step was going to be a challenge, especially in these steep Morvan hills.

It hurt and it was attractive to step out at so many points, but I’m so proud of not giving up and finishing. I will never forget that hill at 18km, where I screamed & grunted of frustration. The tears no one saw me shed, when 5 kilometers later a farmer sprayed me with cold water. And a bit later on when my friend Stef ran with me, to the foot of the last big climb to the finish.

It was my slowest race ever, it took me more time than the 44km race in 2017. But I f*ing did it!

### Shoe
I loved its looks and the engineering that went into the Nike Terra Kiger 5. I loved the promise of a more natural running style of the Vibram Five fingers. But in the end I had the best experience in the Altra Superior 3.5. It's comfortable (for the medium long distances), it's neutral, and it's got space for my super wide feet. A definite winner in 2019!

Because of that and my ultra goal – and because the Ginger Runner tells me so – I'm looking forward to give the Altra Olympus a chance next year’s longer distances. 🤗

## Entertainment
### Music
Balthazar delivered the best album. Lana del Rey delivered the best song. Venice, bitch!

### Film
Yes, Joe Pesci shined bright like a crumpled, old diamond. But no, it’s not the Irishman. It might not be the most original choice. But hey, I’m a Tarantino fan this probably is his second to last film. 😭

Brilliant & brutal, classy & classic. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood takes the prize!

### Game
I don’t game that much anymore. Most games cannot keep my attention for too long, like this year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Awesome production value, but in it's essence a predictable game in a nostalgic packaging. I stopped playing right before the end.

{{<figure src="images/2019-highlights/life-is-strange-2-screenshot.jpg" alt="Silhouettes of two boys looking at a red, snowed-in house" caption="Christmassy vibes in Life is Strange 2, episode 2">}}

Life is Strange 2 is a lovely, coming of age road trip adventure. They released 5 separate episodes and every one is different. It’s beautifully understated, yet so effective. Your actions have consequences, it often offers a different perspective on life or tiny parts of it and it dares to be human. I'm saving episode 5 for the upcoming holidays!

## Tech & gadgets
## App
Waking Up is not just a pretty app. It’s a whole new level of learning about meditation, consciousness and more. Read a bit more about it, in my note [on meditation](/note-on-meditation).

## Device
I just got an Oura Ring, but I’ll tell you about that shiny wearable next year. This year was all about my renewed love for the Apple Watch. I bought the series 4, the one with the bigger screen, and I hadn’t expected to love it as much as I do.

The bigger screen makes it feel more like a proper, good looking and functional watch. It’s health features do not only make me stand up after sitting for too long, but also motivates me by keeping fit.

One feature, being able to compare your activity with friends, is actually a nice way to get competitive. I did 2 week long competitions with my brother, and I won. Twice. Better luck next time, bro!

## Car
I drove the latest Porsche 911 and then some. But I think the Mercedes EQC was the b... Nah. I don’t. 😏

{{<figure src="images/2019-highlights/bram-willemse-porsche-992-carrera-s.jpg" caption="Me acting like I own this car 😬" alt="Bram posing in front of a Porsche Carrera 992 Carrera S">}}

The Porsche 992 Carrera S is a blast to drive, beautiful up to the last detail and just unmatched on it’s all-round high quality. It’s impressive how predictable Porsche is at being the best in this industry, like they are proving with building an impressive first Porsche Full Electric Vehicle too, with the Taycan.
