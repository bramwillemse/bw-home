draft: true
introduction: I have some time to spare and read 'Shape Up', Bootcamp's latest book about doing things (software projects) differently than most of us are used to. In this post I'll give you a summary of their Shape Up idea,  my take on their methods and tools and at the end [SPOILER ALERT] I'll tell you to go read it.

I have too much time at the moment. I came back from a long holiday in France and I'm looking for new freelance project to dive into, while I'm not really sure what I want.

Do I just want to build on a 'regular' front-end job? Or do I actually want to stop doing actual development work and focus on design, product ownership and/or strategy? Most of the times the answer and results lay somewhere in the middle. But it feels like it's (almost) time for a bold decision..

## Books, books, books
Anyways. I have time, so I read quite a lot. I highly recommend the science fantasy 'Broken Earth' trilogy by N.K. Jemisin, but if I remember correctly I brought you here promising to talk about Bootcamp's latest.

Right after I finished 'It doesn't have to be crazy at work' by founder Jason Fried – go read it, it's great! –  out came 'Shape Up', this one by strategist Ryan Singer. The former is about building a calm company, focused on getting the best out of your people, instead of the most. The latter is about Basecamp's way of work, focused on actual product design & development.

## Something different than scrum
In the books foreword, Basecamp founder & CEO Jason Fried positions their method against the most popular ways of work we all know best in software development: Scrum and Kanban. 

The last five years I've worked on multiple scrum projects, mainly with Dept, a Dutch digital agency. Scrum can be a great way to work. 
If teams and organizations understand scrum and embrace it the right way, it can be great. But I also learned that if they don't, it can get messy..

I have worked in and helped set up scrum teams and shape their processes. Most of the times these teams had loads of talent and became independent power houses that shipped and improved every 2 or 3 weeks. That's one of the coolest parts of scrum, becoming this unstoppable train. 

But at times we would deliver great work before the client knew it, and the wouldn't be ready. Or worse: some person high up had in the meanwhile changed their mind. Meaning we had to throw away 3 or 6 weeks worth of work.

In another project the client was cool with everything, but they did not realize what they had started. While they told us we had everything covered, during the work we uncovered loads of black holes. That project still is not live. 

Not that it's always the client's fault. A few of the hardest things for a team is staying focused and not losing time and money on unnecessarily detailed designs, code refactoring or bugfixes.

So I'm glad someone now comes up with a different way of doing things. Although I have to say, it's not as different as Basecamp loves to state it is... 

## Shape Up in a nutshell
The main setup of the Shape Up way of work is this:

1. **Shape** - On an abstract, strategic level, work is shaped as a workable project for a team.
2. **Pitch** - The project is defined and pitched to stakeholders (business, strategy, senior designers & developers). It outlines the problem, solutions, risks & no-gos.
3. **Bet** - Instead of letting the team plan, the company's decision makers bet on projects.
4. **Build** - In 6-week cycles teams get the time & full responsibility to finish 1 big project, or three 2-week small projects.
5. **Cool-down** - After every 6-week cycle, the team gets time off. To tie up loose ends for the last cycle, fix bugs, or try out new things for themselves.

In this setup, there are two teams at work in parallel 6-week cycles. A shaping team (business, strategy & design) and a build team (design & development).

Cycles are for shaping, pitching & building. Cool-down is for betting and 'time off' for the build teams.

I'm not going to dive any deeper into it than this. For the interesting details, be sure to read their book yourself. It's easy to read. I finished it in 3-4 hours.

Below I'll dive into the likeness and differences I see compared to scrum and my perspective on Shapeup's ideas in general.

## Shape Up is pretty scrummy
Shape Up is just a different way of working agile to me. There are a lot of comparisons to scrum, for example.

- There are cycles, like sprints in scrum.
- Every cycle is about shipping something functional, like the minimum viable product (MVP) we all know and love. (Right? ;-)
- Teams are meant to be independent.
- It's iterative. A constant loop of research, design & development.
- It even offers ways to give insight on a team's progress, like burndown charts in Jira. Managers will love it just as much! 

## What sets Shape Up apart
But there are some big differences too. I'll highlight three. Or four. 

### More time
Teams get more time. Time to shape the work, hammer out the weak spots, orient, define tasks & scope, design & build, test & ship. 

People spend less time in meetings, because there are no stand-ups, refinement sessions or sprint planning, "or anything remotely tied to a metaphor that includes being tired and worn out at the end." Eat that, scrum! :P

And they get time to breathe in between cycles, to tie up loose ends or just try something fun and new.

### No designs
Shape Up encourages to keep the specs abstract up to the build phase. No wireframes, no specifics, just text and sketches. Once you hand over the project to the team, they will have 6 weeks to work that out within the clear boundaries you defined.

### Betting
Sprint planning in scrum in short is about the team defining their probable capacity (based on earlier results & capacity) and filling the next sprint to the brim with estimated work.

Shape Up does it differently. There's no points, also no backlog. Just a few projects to pick from that are shaped up for your team already. And the team doesn't choose, although they will provide input. The client's decision makers will pick the project(s) to bet on. 

And if a project is not betted on, there's no backlog to pile up work that needs to be done.

### Cool-down
- A clear focus on speccing work the right way. What they call 'shaping'.
