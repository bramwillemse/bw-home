## Keeping busy

- I am looking for a new freelance product owner job. [Freshly certified](https://www.credly.com/badges/08421a52-3b82-472e-96c7-ef686d323866 "Inspect Bram's PSPO-I certification on Credly") even!
- **I have been running [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/ "Read about Home Assistant")** on a Raspberry Pi for a while now. It's a great open source operating system for my smart home. It makes paid, cloud-based services like IFTTT a thing of my past. Great fun!
- **I am currently reading** [The Professional Product Owner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133269-the-professional-product-owner "Read about the Professional Product Owner by Don McGreal on GoodReads") by Don McGreal, [The Culture Map](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22085568-the-culture-map "Read about The Culture Map by Erin Meyer on GoodReads") by Erin Meyer and [The City We Became](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50308712-the-city-we-became "Read about The City We Became by N.K. Jemisin on GoodReads") by N.K. Jemisin.

## Personal development

- On a monthly basis **I am meeting up with my Mastermind group** with three friends. We help keep ourselves and each other accountable for our personal development goals and discuss themes we run into while doing so.

## Keeping calm &amp; fit

- I **started bouldering** in 2021 and I love it. I try to do it twice a week and I'm climbing up until 5C+ levels.
- **I run**. After spending most my energy in keeping calm through a crisis and a home renovation, I steadily crawled out of my running slump since 2020.  No ambitious plans, but a healthy focus on getting fitter and fitter and running longer and longer distances. Last October I rean the Amsterdam marathon. It was not a lot of fun, so I plan to fully get back to trailrunning after slowly recovering from my first COVID in November '22.  You can follow my progress on [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/bramwillemse "Follow my training progress on Strava").
