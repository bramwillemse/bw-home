## Keeping busy
- At July, 1st **I have started a new project with FedEx** as a front-end developer. I hope to help them out within my holy triangle of front-end devevelopment, design thinking and teamwork.
- **I am building my home**. Since January 23rd I am the proud  owner of the apartment I had been renting the previous 3.5 years. I've moved in to a 2nd apartment with a good friend close by and a team of builders will be building up the interior up until september. It'll be beautiful!
- **I volunteer at Vluchtelingenwerk** [Dutch for "Refugee Work"]. Since November 2019 I have been helping them out as a 'Wijkvrijwilliger' [or 'neighbourhood volunteer']. It means every week or other week, I will hang out with a refugee buddy and help him find his way in Dutch daily life. To be honest, I do not have a lot of energy left right now (see above), but we are still in touch!

## Improving my knowledge & skills
- **I am reading** ['1q84'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10357575-1q84 "Check out the book '1q84' on GoodReads") by Haruki Murakami.
- **I am not drawing many wolves** right now. This is a random idea I had at the start of the year and now I am trying to every week draw a wolf. To get better at drawing and to get to know an animal and my fascination for it. You can [see my drawings on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bramwillemse/albums/72157713134882542). I hope to pick it up again some day this year.

## Keeping calm & fit
- **I run**. I had a small injury, so I've started 2020 very calmly. Right now I'm focusing on form, with help from my physiotherapist. And I am picking up regular strength trainging too. I plan to run my first ultra marathon (later) this year or in 2021, after failing this goal last year. You can follow my progress on [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/bramwillemse "Follow my training progress on Strava").
- **I start my days** with a short yoga exercise and meditation. The yoga exercise consists of the [5 Tibetans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Tibetan_Rites "Read more about the Five Tibetan Rites on Wikipedia"), plus a few extra exercises from my physiotherapist. Following that I will do the daily meditation by Sam Harris in [the Waking Up app](https://share.wakingup.com/2abce0e26219 "Check out the Waking Up app"). Through this link you can get 1 month of free access to the app, no strings attached.
