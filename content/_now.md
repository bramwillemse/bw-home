## Keeping busy

- Since 2020 I am **working for FedEx Express** as a front-end developer and designer. Based on UX Research, A/B-testing and data analysis, my team and I are slowly but steadily improving their customer support experience.
- **I am enjoying my newly renovated home**. Last year I bought and fully renovated my home in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. A year ago I moved in again and since then I'm thoroughly enjoying it. I was joined by a kitten called _Eefje_. At the moment I am working with a carpenter on a design for cabinets spanning half the length of my home and a sliding wall that will create a nice option to gain some privacy in my lofty open space. Cool stuff! 😎
- **I am currently reading** [The Every](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57792078-the-every "Read about The Every by Dave Eggers on GoodReads") by Dave Eggers.

## Personal development

- Bi-weekly **I am meeting up with my Mastermind group** with three friends. We help keep ourselves and each other accountable for our personal development goals and discuss themes we run into while doing so.
- I am actively using my personal **note taking system** in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), a markdown file based note taking app in which I am trying to apply a variation of the 'Zettelkasten' system.
- Inspired by friends I have started to regularly write "Morning Pages"; 15 minutes of stream of conciousness writing. It is an attempt to clear my head, organise my thoughts or just to get my writing juices flowing.

## Keeping calm &amp; fit

- **I try to start most of my days** with a daily meditation by Sam Harris in [the Waking Up app](https://share.wakingup.com/2abce0e26219 "Check out the Waking Up app"). Through this link you can get 1 month of free access to the app, no strings attached.
- Following that I will do some **short yoga exercise**. Which often consists of the [5 Tibetans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Tibetan_Rites "Read more about the Five Tibetan Rites on Wikipedia") or sun salutations, plus a few extra core power and specific exercises prescribed by my physio. [Yoga With Adriene](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui6Eyny-Uzyp5P3Vcuv5qCHQOC8W6grN "Do some Yoga With Adriene on YouTube") is my friend too.
- **I run**. After spending most my energy in keeping calm through a crisis and a home renovation, I steadily crawled out of my running slump since 2020.  No ambitious plans, but a healthy focus on getting fitter and fitter and running longer and longer distances. And last November I ran a 30km trail run on Schiermonnikoog, my first race in 2 years! Hopefully at some point all this will lead up to running that first ultra marathon I've been aiming for the last few years! You can follow my progress on [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/bramwillemse "Follow my training progress on Strava").
