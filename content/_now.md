## Keeping busy
- **I am looking for a new freelance project** as a designer, front-end developer, team lead or best: the golden combination of those three.
- **I am building my home**. Since January 23rd I am the proud  owner of the apartment I had been renting the previous 3.5 years. I've moved to an apartment around the block, and right now I am doing all the demolition work myself, preparing it for a contractor to make it livable and beautiful.
- **I write** about my personal development, apps and hardware that I test and use, and other developments in my work.
- **I volunteer at Vluchtelingenwerk** [Dutch for "Refugee Work"]. Since November 2019 I have been helping them out as a 'Wijkvrijwilliger' [or 'neighbourhood volunteer']. It means every week or other week, I will hang out with a refugee buddy and help him find his way in Dutch daily life.

## Keeping calm & fit
- **I run**. I had a small injury, so I've started 2020 very calmly. Right now I'm focusing on form, with help from my physiotherapist. And I have to pick up strength training again soon too. I plan to run my first ultra marathon (later) this year, after failing this goal last year. You can follow my progress on [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/bramwillemse "Follow my training progress on Strava").
- **I start my days** with a short yoga exercise and meditation. The yoga exercise consists of the [5 Tibetans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Tibetan_Rites "Read more about the Five Tibetan Rites on Wikipedia"), plus a few extra exercises from my physiotherapist. Following that I will do the daily meditation by Sam Harris in [the Waking Up app](https://share.wakingup.com/2abce0e26219 "Check out the Waking Up app"). Through this link you can get 1 month of free access to the app, no strings attached.

## Improving my knowledge & skills
- **I am reading** ['Donkerder'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53319828-donkerder "Check out the book 'Donkerder' on GoodReads") by my good friend Ritzo ten Cate, ['Socrates op Sneakers'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49105212-socrates-op-sneakers "Check out the book 'Socrates op Sneakers' on GoodReads") by Elke Wiss and I am (still) working on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes" title="Check out the book 'How to take smart notes' on GoodReads">'How to take smart notes'</a> by Sönke Ahrens.
- **I draw wolves**. This is a random idea I had at the start of the year and now I am trying to every week draw a wolf. To get better at drawing and to get to know an animal and my fascination for it. You can [see my drawings on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bramwillemse/albums/72157713134882542).
